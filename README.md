1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. HTML & CSS
4. Java
---------------------------------------------------
   ### Useful Extensions for Students
One  of the biggest strengths of VS Code is its extension marketplace. Extension allows you to add extra features to the editor

1. **Python extension** - Run and debug python code
2. **Prettier**-Automatically format code
3. **Live server**- Preview web project live
4. **Gitlens**- Understand git changes
5. **Debugger**- Helps to detect errors
6. **Themes**- Improve appearance and readability

   ------------------------------------------------
 ### Overview of vs code features
   The following features are what makes Vs code a powerful and beginner-friendly

- *Built in terminal*-this feature helps your to run commands without leaving the editor
- *Smart code suggestions*- Suggest codes while you type, complete words for your and helps to prevent errors.
- *Debugging tool*- This feature find and fixes mistakes (bugs) in you code.

  -------------------------------------------------------
 ### Python
  *Python* is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
 ### Key features

  - Interpreted Language- Runs code line-by-line, making debugging easier.
  - Cross platform- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux and more.
  - Open source - Free to use and supported by a large global community.

    -------------------------------------
### Python support in VS code
VS Code provides excellent support for python through the official python extention. Python is a beginner friendly language with simple syntax and when combined with 
VS Code, it becomes a powerful learning environment
With python extension installed, students can:

- Get intelligent code  suggestions.
- Detect errors while typing.
- Format code automatically.
- Run python programs using the built in terminal.

  - Push and Pull from GitHub
  - View differences between file versions.
    
These features  are very important for teamwork because it helps to track changes and prevent losing work.

------------
### Debugging Tools

**A debugging tool** is a tool that helps to find and fix mistakes (bugs) in code.

**Key debugging features include:**
1. Breakpoint (pause code at a specific line)
2. Steps over and steps into execution.
3. Variable inspection
4. Debug console for viewing output and errors

 Debugging helps students understand how their code runs and improves problems-solving skills.
 
 ----------------------------------
 ### Theme and Customization
 VS code allows users to customize their environment for comfort and productivity.
 Students can:
 - Choose dark or light themes
 - install custom icon themes
 - Adjust fonts and layout
 - Customize keyboard shortcuts
   
A comfortable coding environment reduces eye strain and improves focus during long study sessions.

----------
### How VS code Helps Students Write, Test and Debug Efficiently

VS code improve productivity by combining writing, testing and debugging tools in one place.

1. While writing code, smart suggestions reduce typing errors.
2. The built-in terminal allows students to test programs instantly.
3. Debugging tools help identify and fix problems quickly.
4. Git integration supports collaboration and project management.

   ----------------------------------------

### Tips for Beginners

If you are new to VS code, consider the following tips:

- Install only necessary extenstions to avoid clutter.
- Learn basic keyboard shortcuts to save time.
