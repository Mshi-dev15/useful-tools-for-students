These features  are very important for teamwork because it helps to track changes and prevent losing work.

------------
### Debugging Tools

**A debugging tool** is a tool that helps to find and fix mistakes (bugs) in code.

**Key debugging features include:**
1. Breakpoint (pause code at a specific line)
2. Steps over and steps into execution.
3. Variable inspection
4. Debug console for viewing output and errors

 Debugging helps students understand how their code runs and improves problems-solving skills.

## Notion  
### Basic Introduction to Notion

Notion is an all-in-one digital workspace designed to help students manage their academic life in one place. It combines note-taking, task management, databases, and collaboration tools into a single platform. Instead of using multiple apps for notes, assignments, and planning, students can organize everything inside Notion.

It is especially useful for staying organized, tracking deadlines, and structuring study materials clearly.

**Block-Based Editing:**  
Every piece of content (text, image, checklist, table) is a movable block. This makes it easy to restructure notes at any time.

**Rich Formatting Options:**  
Students can add headings, bullet points, numbered lists, quotes, images, links, and embedded content to keep notes clear and organized.

**Databases:**  
Notion allows users to create structured tables and categorized content. Students can organize subjects, topics, readings, and resources efficiently.

**Search Function:**  
The built-in search tool helps students quickly find notes or assignments.

These features make studying and reviewing easier.

Multiple users can edit the same page at the same time.

**Comments and Mentions:**  
Students can leave comments and tag teammates using @ to notify them.

**Sharing Permissions:**  
Pages can be shared with view-only, comment, or editing access.

**Team Workspaces:**  
Groups can create shared folders to organize project materials in one place.

This improves communication and keeps everyone aligned.

## Canva
**<ins>Basic introduction to canva</ins>**

* *Canva* is a user-friendly, web-based graphic design platform launched in 2013 with the goal of making design accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level. It operates on a "freemium" model, allowing users to create, edit, and share designs using a drag-and-drop interface.

## Here are key points for an introduction to Canva:
<ins>Core Functionalities & Features</ins>

## Collaboration features
*the following demonstrates how to set up a team and start collaborating in Canva:*
* **Real-Time Editing**: Multiple users can edit the same design, presentation, or Canva Doc simultaneously, with changes instantly reflected.
* **Comments & Feedback**: Users can leave comments on specific elements, tag colleagues using "@", and resolve discussions.
* **Sharing & Permissions**: Designs can be shared with specific people via email or via a link with tailored permissions for viewing, editing, or commenting.
* **Team Workspaces & Folders**: Shared folders allow teams to centralize projects, brand assets, and templates, keeping everyone organized.
* **Design Approvals**: A built-in approval workflow allows users to request feedback, and reviewers can approve or return designs with comments.
* **Whiteboards**: Ideal for brainstorming, Whiteboards feature sticky notes, reactions, and the ability to "follow" a user's view for guided presentations.

## Tips for creating a visually appealing work

 **Master Layout & Composition**
* ***Embrace Negative Space***: Do not feel the need to fill every corner. "White space" (which doesn't have to be white) allows your design to "breathe" and prevents a cluttered, overwhelming look.
* ***Establish a Focal Point***: Determine the most important part of your message and make it the most prominent using scale, bold colors, or central positioning.
* ***Use the Rule of Thirds***: Mentally divide your canvas into a 3x3 grid. Placing key elements at the intersection points of these lines creates a naturally balanced and engaging composition.
* ***Align Elements Precisely***: Use Canva's Tidy Up tool (under the Position menu) to ensure icons, text boxes, and images are perfectly aligned and evenly spaced.

2. **Strategic Use of Color & Typography**
* ***Limit Your Palette***: Stick to a small color scheme of 2 to 4 colors. Use neutral tones for most of the design and reserve intense colors for call-to-action buttons or critical information.
* ***Follow the "Two Font" Rule***: Using too many fonts makes a design look messy. Select one font for headings and another for body text that complement each other (e.g., a bold serif with a clean sans serif).
3. **Enhance Visual Quality**
* ***Choose High-Resolution Assets***: Avoid blurry or pixelated images. If your own photos are low quality, use the Canva Image Enhancer app to upscale them using AI.
* ***Leverage Grids and Frames***: Instead of "naked" images placed randomly, use Frames to house photos in clean shapes (circles, borders, etc.) for a more polished look.
* ***Ensure High Contrast***: To maintain readability, pair light text with dark backgrounds or vice versa. If a background photo is too light for text, use the Transparency tool to fade the image slightly. 
4. **Workflow Shortcuts for a Polished Finish**
* ***Customize Templates***: Don't use a template exactly as it appears. Change colors, swap photos, and adjust fonts to match your specific brand or project goals.
* ***Use Brand Kits***: For Pro users, save your logo, signature fonts, and brand colors in the Brand Kit to ensure consistency across multiple projects.
* ***Add Subtle Motion***: Incorporate Animations to draw attention to key elements, but use them sparingly to avoid distracting from your message.
